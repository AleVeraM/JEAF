This folder contains the data for the benchmark function of the "SOCO Special Issue on Large Scale Continuous Optimization Problems"

M. Lozano, F. Herrera, D. Molina (Eds.). Scalability of Evolutionary Algorithms and other Metaheuristics for Large Scale Continuous Optimization Problems. Soft Computing 2011.

Experimental Framework
- A set of 19 scalable function optimization problems were provided:
		* 6 Funcionts: F1-F6 of the CEC'2008 test suite. A detailled description may be found in: K. Tang, X. 		Yao, P. N. Suganthan, C. MacNish, Y. P. Chen, C. M. Chen, and Z. Yang. Benchmark Functions for the 			CEC'2008 Special Session and Competition on Large Scale Global Optimization. Technical Report, Nature 		Inspired Computation and Applications Laboratory, USTC, China, 2007. (Source code).
		* 5 Shifted Functions: Schwefel’s Problem 2.22 (F7), Schwefel’s Problem 1.2 (F8), Extended f10 (F9), 		Bohachevsky (F10), and Schaffer (F11). (Description) (Source code).
		* 8 Hybrid Composition Functions (F12-F19*): They are non-separable functions built by combining two 		functions belonging to the set of functions F1-F11 (Description) (Source code).

Document with a complete description of the 19 test functions: Description F1-F19*

- Each algorithm is run 25 times for each test function.
- The performance measures that were provided are:
		* Average of error of the best individuals found in the 25 runs. For a solution x, the error measure 		is defined as: f(x)-f(op), where op is the optimum of the function.
		* Maximum error achieved in the 25 runs.
		* Minimum error achieved in the 25 runs.
		* Median of the error achieved in the 25 runs.
		* The study was made with dimensions D = 50, D = 100, D=200, D=500, and D = 1,000. The maximum number 		of fitness evaluations is 5,000·D. Each run stops when the maximal number of evaluations is achieved.
