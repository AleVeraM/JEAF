JEAF
====

The JAVA Evolutionary Algorithm Framework (JEAF) is a collection of JAVA libraries developed in the Integrated Group for Engineering Research (GII) containing several evolutionary algorithms, real-parameter benchmark functions and analysis tools that can be applied in evolutionary computation R&D. This framework is intensively used by the researchers of the GII and, consequently, it is in continuous improvement and extension.
